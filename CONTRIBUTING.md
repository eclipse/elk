# Contributing to Eclipse Layout Kernel

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Visual languages are popular for visualizing concepts and systems. However, just
being graphical in nature does not automatically make a diagram easy to
understand. Its usefulness much rather depends on the placement of its elements,
that is: on its layout. Getting the layout right is labour intensive and time
consuming and can be made a lot easier by making algorithms do the work. The
Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK) provides such layout algorithms, as well as an
infrastructure to connect them to diagram editors.

## Creating issues

Before creating a new issue with a question, bug report, feature request or similar, 
please use the search to avoid creating duplicate issues. In most cases when you create 
an issue it is helpful to create and link an example in [elklive](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/).
There you can also select the version of ELK that should be used.
For questions regarding layout options, the [reference](https://eclipse.dev/elk/reference.html)
can help. In particular you can see what options are supported by which algorithms.
If these resources are not sufficient to solve your problem, please create an issue using the appropriate template!
