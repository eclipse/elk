# Contributing to Eclipse Layout Kernel

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Visual languages are popular for visualizing concepts and systems. However, just
being graphical in nature does not automatically make a diagram easy to
understand. Its usefulness much rather depends on the placement of its elements,
that is: on its layout. Getting the layout right is labour intensive and time
consuming and can be made a lot easier by making algorithms do the work. The
Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK) provides such layout algorithms, as well as an
infrastructure to connect them to diagram editors.
