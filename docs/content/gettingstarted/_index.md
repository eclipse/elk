Automatic layout can be a complex thing, but starting to use the _Eclipse Layout Kernel_ can be easy.

First of all, there are two versions of ELK. The [Java Version](https://github.com/eclipse-elk/elk) and the Javascript Version, which is transpiled from the Java source using [GWT](https://www.gwtproject.org/).

Examples of ELK graphs can be found [here](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/examples.html) in the [elklive](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/index.html) tool, which supports writing ELK graphs in the [ELKT](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/elkgraph.html) and [JSON](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/json.html) format, can convert between different formats, and allows browsing additional models.

All layout algorithms and their options are documented [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html) and further elaborated in a series of [blog-posts](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/blog.html).

## Issues and Questions

Both [ELK](https://github.com/eclipse-elk/elk/issues/new) and [elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) allow to report bugs and to ask questions in form of GitHub issues.

Additionally, the [ELK gitter](https://gitter.im/eclipse-elk/elk) can be used to ask questions.

## Downloads

ELK is published as an [Eclipse update site](https://download.eclipse.org/elk/updates/releases) or on [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.eclipse.elk).

The elkjs Version is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elkjs).

Releases, nightly builds, and release notes are found [here](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/downloads.html).
