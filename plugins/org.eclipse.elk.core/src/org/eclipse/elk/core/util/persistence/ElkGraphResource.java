/**
 * A specialized resource for ELK graphs registered through extension points by the plug-in. This implementation
 * customizes the way ELK graphs are serialized and deserialized in the following ways.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Serialization</h3>
 * 
 * <p>When saving a graph, normally all of its elements and properties would be saved in a String representation.
 * To be deserialized again, however, Object type properties must be associated with a data type class which
 * implements {@link org.eclipse.elk.core.util.IDataObject IDataObject}. Not all properties do that. If a
 * property does not, it doesn't make sense to serialize it since we won't be able to deserialize them again
 * anyway. This implementation causes such property values to not be serialized.</p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Deserialization</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Deserializing properties requries the
 * {@link org.eclipse.elk.core.data.LayoutMetaDataService LayoutMetaDataService} to obtain appropriate
 * {@link org.eclipse.elk.core.data.LayoutOptionData LayoutOptionData} objects to be able to parse option
 * values. This cannot be done in the graph plug-in with the graph factory's conversion methods, since the
 * graph plug-in does not have access to the meta data service. Thus, this implementation catches these cases
 * and handles them properly.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that the old graph structure featured a <em>persistent entries</em> map which was a String-String
 * representation of properties and properties values. Using this implementation, that persistent entries map
 * became obsolete.</p>
