/**
 * The main entry point into ELK Layered. ELK Layered is a layout algorithm after the layered
 * layout method proposed by Sugiyama et al. It is structured into five main phases: cycle breaking,
 * layering, crossing minimization, node placement, and edge routing. Before these phases and after
 * the last phase so called intermediate layout processors can be inserted that do some kind of pre
 * or post processing. Implementations of the different main phases specify the intermediate layout
 * processors they require, which are automatically collected and inserted between the main phases.
 * The layout provider itself also specifies some dependencies.
 *

 *
 * <p>To use ELK Layered to layout a given graph, there are three possibilities depending on the kind
 * of graph that is to be laid out:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #doLayout(LGraph, IElkProgressMonitor)} computes a layout for the given graph, without
 *     any subgraphs it might have.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #doCompoundLayout(LGraph, IElkProgressMonitor)} computes a layout for the given graph
 *     and for its subgraphs, if any. (Subgraphs are attached to nodes through the
 *     {@link InternalProperties#NESTED_LGRAPH} property.)</li>
 *   <li>If you have an {@code ElkNode} instead of an {@code LGraph}, you might want to use
 *     {@link LayeredLayoutProvider#layout(org.eclipse.elk.graph.ElkNode, IElkProgressMonitor)}
 *     instead.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>In addition to regular layout runs, this class provides methods for automatic unit testing based
 * around the concept of <em>test runs</em>. A test run is executed as follows:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Call {@link #prepareLayoutTest(LGraph)} to start a new run. The given graph might be split
 *       into its connected components, which are put into the returned state object.</li>
 *   <li>Call one of the actual test methods. {@link #runLayoutTestStep(TestExecutionState)} runs the
 *       next step of the algorithm. {@link #runLayoutTestUntil(Class, TestExecutionState)} runs the
 *       algorithm until a given layout processor has finished executing (its sibling,
 *       {@link #runLayoutTestUntil(Class, boolean, TestExecutionState)}, can also stop just before a
 *       given layout processor starts executing). All of these methods resume execution from where the
 *       algorithm has stopped previously.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>ELK Layered also supports the ELK unit test framework through being a white box testable algorithm.</p>
