/**
 * This algorithm is an implementation for solving the node placement problem
 * which is posed in phase 4 of the ELK Layered algorithm. Inspired by:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Ulrik Brandes and Boris K&ouml;pf, Fast and simple horizontal coordinate assignment.
 *     In <i>Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Graph Drawing (GD'01)</i>,
 *     LNCS vol. 2265, pp. 33-36, Springer, 2002. </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The original algorithm was extended to be able to cope with ports, node sizes, and node margins,
 * and was made more stable in general. The algorithm is structured in five steps, which include two new
 * steps which were not included in the original algorithm by Brandes and Koepf. The middle three steps
 * are executed four times, traversing the graph in all combinations of TOP or BOTTOM and LEFT or
 * RIGHT.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In ELK Layered we have the general idea of layouting from left to right and
 * transforming in the desired direction later. We decided to translate the terminology of the original
 * algorithm which thinks of a layout from top to bottom. When placing coordinates, we have to differ
 * from the original algorithm, since node placement in ELK Layered has to assign y-coordinates and not
 * x-coordinates.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The variable naming in this code is mostly chosen for an iteration direction within our
 * left to right convention. Arrows describe iteration direction.
 * 
 * LEFT                  RIGHT
 * <----------           ------->
 * 
 * UP    ^              DOWN |
 *       |                   |
 *       |                   v
 * </p>   
 *      
 * <h4>The algorithm:</h4>
 * 
 * <p>The first step checks the graphs' edges and marks short edges which cross long edges (called
 * type 1 conflict). The algorithm indents to draw long edges as straight as possible, thus trying to
 * solve the marked conflicts in a way which keep the long edge straight.</p>
 * 
 * <p>============ UP, DOWN x LEFT, RIGHT ============</p>
 * 
 * <p>The second step traverses the graph in the given directions and tries to group connected nodes
 * into (horizontal) blocks. These blocks, respectively the contained nodes, will be drawn straight when
 * the algorithm is finished. Here, type 1 conflicts are resolved, so that the dummy nodes of a long
 * edge share the same block if possible, such that the long edge is drawn straightly.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The third step contains the addition of node size and port positions to the original algorithm.
 * Each block is investigated from top to bottom. Nodes are moved inside the blocks, such that the port
 * of the edge going to the next node is on the same level as that next node. Furthermore, the size of
 * the block is calculated, regarding node sizes and new space needed due to node movement.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the fourth step, actual y-coordinates are determined. The blocks are placed, start block and
 * direction determined by the directions of the current iteration. It is tried to place the blocks as
 * compact as possible by grouping blocks.</p>
 *  
 * <p>======================= END =======================</p>
 * 
 * <p>The action of the last step depends on a layout option. If "fixedAlignment" is not set to 
 * BALANCED, one of the four calculated layouts is selected and applied, choosing the layout which 
 * uses the least space. If it is false, a balanced layout is chosen by calculating a median layout 
 * of all four layouts.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In rare cases, it is possible that one or more layouts is not correct, e.g. having nodes which
 * overlap each other or violating the layer ordering constraint. If the algorithm detects that, the
 * respective layout is discarded and another one is chosen.</p>
 * 
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>Preconditions:</dt>
 *     <dd>The graph has a proper layering with optimized nodes ordering</dd>
 *     <dd>Ports are properly arranged</dd>
 *   <dt>Postconditions:</dt>
 *     <dd>Each node is assigned a vertical coordinate such that no two nodes overlap</dd>
 *     <dd>The size of each layer is set according to the area occupied by its nodes</dd>
 *     <dd>The height of the graph is set to the maximal layer height</dd>
