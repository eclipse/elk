/**
 * Inserts dummy nodes to cope with northern and southern ports.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each node with northern or southern ports, dummy nodes are inserted in the node's layer above
 * or below the node. (for northern and southern ports, respectively) Assume that a node has several
 * northern ports. First, the ports are assembled in left-to-right order according to their
 * position. Then, the ports are partitioned into ports with only incoming edges (in ports), ports
 * with only outgoing edges (out ports) and ports with both, incoming and outgoing edges (in/out
 * ports). The way the dummy nodes are then created can either be according to the
 * <em>old approach</em> or the <em>new approach</em>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>The Old Approach</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In and out ports are matched up left to right and right to left, respectively, as long as the out
 * port is right of the in port. In the example below, ports P1 and P6 will be matched, as will be
 * ports P2 and P5. Ports P3 and P4 will not be matched since P3 is an out port and not right of P4.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For each pair of matched ports, a dummy node is then inserted that is shared by both ports. This
 * leads to edges of both ports sharing the same y coordinate, which is fine as long as the out port
 * is right of the in port. When this is no longer the case, ports cannot share a dummy node
 * anymore. (the horizontal edge segments would overlap and thus introduce ambiguity) Thus, P4 and
 * P3 each get their own dummy node.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once in and out ports are processed, in/out ports are given their own dummy node.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This approach minimizes the amount of edge crossings among the edges connected to northern ports
 * locally, without paying attention to the rest of the graph. To do that, this approach fixes the
 * order of the dummy nodes in the layer: the node successor constraints are set in a way that each
 * dummy node points to the next, with the bottom-most northern dummy node pointing to the regular
 * node it was created for.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                      ------------------------------
 *                      |
 * ---------------------+----
 *                      |   |
 * ------------------   |   |   ----------------------
 *                  |   |   |   |
 * --------------   |   |   |   |   ------------------
 *              |   |   |   |   |   |
 *              P1  P2  P3  P4  P5  P6
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>The New Approach</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The new approach is designed to not fix the order of dummy nodes at this point and to instead
 * leave the task of ordering them to the crossing minimization phase. It creates a single dummy
 * node for every northern port, without two ports sharing a dummy node. The only necessary
 * constraints are that dummy nodes created for northern ports must have their regular node as their
 * successor. (Similarly, the regular node must have all dummy nodes created for southern ports as
 * successors.)
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Self-Loops</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Self-loops are a special case that is handled partly by this processor. For this to work, the
 * {@link DummySelfLoopProcessor} must have been executed prior to this processor's execution. Then, this
 * processor correctly processes all kinds of self-loops involving northern or southern ports as
 * follows: (due to the {@link DummySelfLoopProcessor}, only the cases detailled below must be handled)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>West-north, west-south, north-east and south-east self-loops are handled just like every
 * other connection.</li>
 * <li>North-north and south-south self-loops are handled by creating a dummy node just for that
 * self-loop.</li>
 * <li>North-south self-loops are handled by adding a northern and a southern dummy, both having
 * just one port via which they are connected. At the moment, the port is created on the eastern
 * side of the dummy node, but that could be handled more clerverly later.</li>
 * </ul>
